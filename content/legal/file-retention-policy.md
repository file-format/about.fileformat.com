FileFormat does not provide a service that collects files from its users. From time to time a customer may send documents to the support team via the forums for the purpose of diagnosis of the file format. These files are maintained only as long as necessary to complete the required task and the customer can ask for these files to be removed at any time.</div>
<div class="col-md-12"> </div>
<div class="col-md-12">If the customer marks a thread as private none of these files are accessible to any person other than the customer and select FileFormat staff. </div>
