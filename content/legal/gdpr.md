<h3><strong>FileFormat and the GDPR</strong></h3>
<p>On the 25<sup>th</sup> May 2018 the European Union began enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It impacts how businesses collect and process data from European individuals. While FileFormat is an Australian Business with no European entity, it values the rights of its users’ and customers and their personal data regardless of their location. As such we’re working hard to comply with these rules across all our systems and processes.</p>
<p>This page gives an overview of the roles described by the GDPR, the responsibilities of each party and the efforts we’re putting in place to support these recommendations.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> </div>
<h3><strong>FileFormat as the data processor</strong></h3>
<p>While using our services you may upload files for processing via our web service platforms, you may also send our Support Team files for debug or support purposes. Due to the nature of our products and services, your files may contain information from or about your clients. While covered by the confidentiality clauses in our EULA, the upcoming updates to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy further cement these rights.</p>
<p>These are your data subjects, and you are considered the data controller for this personal data. Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy refer to this data as Client Data.</p>
<p>Using FileFormat services to process your Client Data means that you have engaged FileFormat as a data processor to carry out certain data processing activities on your behalf. Article 28 of the GDPR states that the relationship between the controller and the processor needs to be made in writing (electronic form is acceptable under subsection (9) of Article 28). Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy also serve as your data processing contract with FileFormat. They set out the instructions you are giving to FileFormat in regards to processing personal data you control and establishing the rights and responsibilities of both parties. FileFormat will only process your Client Data based on your instructions as the data controller.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> </div>
<h3><strong>Data Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>When data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) by data processors, the GDPR sets strict requirements for moving data outside of the scope if its protection.  </p>
<p>As FileFormat is an Australian business with no European entity, the data controller makes the sole decision to transfer data to FileFormat which is based in Australia outside of the EEA, with its technical infrastructure based in the US. Where we do engage with sub-processors we do so in a considered fashion considering the legalities of the transfer at each step.</p>
<p>We’ll keep an up-to-date list of sub-processors in our Terms of Use. This ensures we are fully transparent about our transfers and the processors we use. We’ll explain the data we transfer and for what purpose. We only engage with sub-processors who have either certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework or signed the EU Commission’s standard contractual clauses for data transfers with us.</p>

<h3><strong>What is FileFormat doing for the GDPR</strong></h3>
<p>FileFormat respects the privacy of its customers and their clients. To that end, we have implemented and continue to improve both technical and organizational measures in line with the GDPR to ensure the appropriate processing of personal data.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> </div>
<h3><strong>Internal processes, security and data transfers</strong></h3>
<p>We have reviewed our internal processes and operations to make sure we map and audit the data travelling through our systems. We are implementing functionality within all our main customer facing systems to cope with the principles of Privacy by Design. Any access to Client Data is only done through the permission of our customers and is always limited and specifically in scope to the contract between FileFormat and its customers have engaged in.</p>
<p>Our internal procedures and logs make sure that we meet the GDPR accountability requirements.</p>
<p>We onboard new third-party services rarely, but when we do we have an internal process for evaluating these suppliers on their security and privacy considerations. We keep the number of sub-processors to a minimum, where possible using our own technology and infrastructure for processing.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> </div>
<h3><strong>Ability to action subject access requests</strong></h3>
<p>Data subjects’ ownership of their personal data is at the heart of the GDPR. We are working on a plan to respond to data subject requests to delete, modify, or transfer their data. This means that our Customer Support Specialists along with the Engineers that assist them in their work are well-prepared to help you in any matters involving your personal data.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> </div>
<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>
<p>Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are updated regularly to make sure we build upon the good work we’ve always done in this area. As these documents set out the basis of our relationship with you, it is of paramount importance for us to openly and clearly explain your rights in these documents.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> </div>
<h3><strong> Training and awareness</strong></h3>
<p>Training and awareness about GDPR, the handling of and processing of Personal Data have been communicated throughout the whole FileFormat Business. Each FileFormat Team Member has awareness of the issues and our policies surrounding the compliance with GDPR and other Privacy related issues. We have built this training into our new team member training requirements and have scheduled refresher checks regularly.</p>
<p><strong>We believe the above approach in adhering to the GDPR is firmly in line with the ethos of its purpose and what it aims to achieve.</strong></p>
